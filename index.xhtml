		<h2>Experience</h2>
			<p>My experience in IT is working at Bunnings Callcenter between 2002 and 2005. I was young and away from my family 
			being in Western Australia and my family is in Sydney. I am also not a fan of shift work so it didn't work out well for me.</p>
			
			<p>For now I mostly work in the assisted checkouts where I am able to help people. I love assisting customers with 
			general enquiries and issues relating to the self-assist checkouts.</p>
